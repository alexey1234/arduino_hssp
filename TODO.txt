Currently in my building not work setup and cycle TARGET Vdd

I will wrote here about my work


I will rebuilt programmer? because I connect to board which have capacitors and other chips, so I mus to give more power to this pin.

I want replace lm7805 to switched supply 

fPowerCycleInitializeTargetForISSP(void) from issp_routines - after set target voltage it wait 1ms which not really
 ReStartTarget(void) from issp_routines
	fragment
	RemoveTargetVDD();
    delayMicroseconds(POWER_CYCLE_DELAY); //150 usec delay is fantastic? not will work
    ApplyTargetVDD();
used into main progra  void end_pmode()

digitalread arduino take 4uS
analog Read arduino takes about 0.1usec
digitalwrite arduino take about  4uSec

May be need use more fast command, for example https://github.com/mikaelpatel/Arduino-GPIO/tree/master
or use assembler into arduinoIDE assembler

void somefunction(void) __attribute__((naked))
{
  asm volatile ("

 ; your assembly code here

  ");
}
