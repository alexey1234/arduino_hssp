Currently in my building work setup and cycle TARGET Vdd

I write my troubles about my work in folder troubles


I rebuild programmer, because I connect to board which have capacitors and other chips, so I mus to give more power to this pin.

I build switched Power supply with switches ON and OFF on 200 Avper Mosfets ( from broken motherboard ) 

But I see problem with parametrization from host (may be something wrong into psocdude )

## support for parametrization by host.
The parametrization packet is currently 5 bytes long and contains the following values:
- programming_mode selection (power cycle vs external reset)
- target_voltage selection
- checksum_setup vector selection
- program_block vector selection
- multi_bank support selection
Need check how it work - I plan add second Serial port to arduino (software serial ) and debug some data.

## Planinig
Add support for use programmer with multiple target chips.
