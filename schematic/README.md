# arduino_hssp programmer schematic

This is  my building of programmer hardware 

Such a complex circuit is needed because there are many more chips on my board that are powered by the same 5 Volt voltage. 

There are  many capacitors on the board also , so turning these 5 Volts on and off with a regular Arduino is quite problematic, an amplifier is needed
